# Content Panel Component Examples

Here are examples of how to use the content panel components in your MDX files:

## Small Content Panels

<ContentPanelSmall id="example-1">
# Example Small Panel

This is a small content panel. You can put any markdown content inside it:

- Lists work great
- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com) are supported

<hr class="panel-divider" />

You can add more content after the divider.
</ContentPanelSmall>

<ContentPanelSmall id="example-2" className="custom-class">
# Custom Styling Example

You can add custom CSS classes using the `className` prop.

The `id` prop is optional but useful for targeting with JavaScript or CSS.
</ContentPanelSmall>

## Large Content Panel

<ContentPanelLarge id="large-example">
# Large Panel Example

Large content panels span the full width and are great for:

1. **Comprehensive documentation sections**
2. **Resource collections**
3. **Detailed explanations**
4. **Multi-column content layouts**

<hr class="panel-divider" />

### Sub-sections work well too

You can include multiple headings, paragraphs, code blocks, and any other markdown content.

```javascript
// Even code blocks!
const example = "This is a code example";
console.log(example);
```

</ContentPanelLarge>
